# Pegasus Republic

Pegasus Republic is a Smart Contract deployed on the Binance Smart Chain which is a experimental community project that aims to elimate developer control, greediness and manipulation.

The idea behind the token is that the no single user has a significant control (less than 3%) and instead of the developers deciding the inflation, tax and burn rates the community does through DAO governed voting.

# Contracts

This repository contains 2 contracts under the `/contracts` directory.

- `PegasusRepublic.sol` - This contains the deployed contract which enforces the ERC20 standard
- `BobHorseman.sol` - This is a no ownership contract which acts as the burn address for Pegasus Republic.

# Website

The website uses React, Tailwind, Typescript and Web3 to connect to the Binance Smart Chain.

The main purpose is to allow users to vote on the upcoming tokenomics.

# How to get started?
